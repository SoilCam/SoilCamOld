one="-resize 1080x"
two="-crop 1080x"
three="-rotate 270"
four=""

#examples:
#	-resize x1080		will resize your image so it is 1080 pixels tall
#	-crop 1920x1080+50+0	will crop a 1920x1080 pixel image, starting 50 pixels in from the top? (can not remember...)
#	-rotate 270		will rotate your image by 270 degrees
#	keep in mind the order of operations, rotating, cropping, and then resizing will take longer than if you were to resize first.

#	If you get the error "[libx264 @ 0x123d900] width not divisible by 2 (769x1080)"
#	Fix this by using the "-crop" command, for example: "-crop 769x1080-1+0" You will need to adjust the first two crop values by those in the error message
