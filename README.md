These are a series of short scripts intended to make it easier for one to create timelapse videos using scanners.

It requires a number of programs that do the real work:
 - Apache (optional)
 - AVConv
 - Bash
 - ImageMagick
 - SANE

It requires hardware:
 - USB Powered Scanner that is fully compatible with SANE ( http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html )
 - Powered USB Hub

It is intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian. It will likely run on other hardware (Pi 1 is fine, just a lot slower)
